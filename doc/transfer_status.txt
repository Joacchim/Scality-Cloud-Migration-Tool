This document describes the transfer status file in a detailed manner.

A transfer status file (or ".cloudmig file") describes the transfer status of
one and only one bucket. The name of the file matches the bucket's name.

This file format is quite simple since it's only goal is to help maintaining an
updated status of the account's migration.

Thus, the file is a concatenation of files status, which are binary data
directly written into the file. For compatibility purposes, the data must be
written in big endian byte-order (thus following the network byte-order).

Here is a table describing the binary format of one entry (each integer being
                                                           written in big
                                                           endian byte-order):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| integer (4 bytes) : length of the file's name. (rounded to a superior       |
|                                                 multiple of 4)              |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| integer (4 bytes) : whole file size.                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| integer (4 bytes) : Current writing offset (used in case of interruption in |
|                                             order to resume the migration)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data : filename data padded in order to reach the length of the first       |
|        integer rounded to the superior 4 multiple.                          |
|                                                                             |
|                                                                             |
|                                                                             |

Those files will be contained in a bucket created for this sole purpose on the
source's storage space. Since a migration should be seen as an atomic action,
the user should never try to migrate a source accoutn to two different
destination accounts, thus avoiding status bucket conflicts (the name of the
status bucket is computed from the source and destination host).
