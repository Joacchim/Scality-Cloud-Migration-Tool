This document describes the file format of the general migration status in a
detailed manner.

As of now, this format does not contain a header, but one could be added
in the future in order to maintain a sort of general informations on the
migration.

The current format is a concatenation of names associations. A name association
contains two integers representing the length of two following strings that are
a bucket status filename and the associated destination bucket name.

Here is a table describing the binary format of one entry (each integer being
                                                           written in big
                                                           endian byte-order):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| integer (4 bytes) : length of the bucket status file's name, rounded to a   |
|                     superior multiple of 4 with the following formula :     |
|                     X + (4 - X % 4))                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| integer (4 bytes) : length of the destination bucket's name, rounded to a   |
|                     superior multiple of 4 with the following formula :     |
|                     X + (4 - X % 4))                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data : filename data padded in order to reach the length of the first       |
|        integer rounded to the superior 4 multiple. The padding should be    |
|        a filling of terminating nul caracters.                              |
|                                                                             |
|                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data : bucket name data padded in order to reach the length of the second   |
|        integer rounded to the superior 4 multiple. The padding should be    |
|        a filling of terminating nul caracters.                              |
|                                                                             |
|                                                                             |

This file will be contained in a bucket created for this sole purpose on the
source's storage space. Since a migration should be seen as an atomic action,
the user should never try to migrate a source account to two different
destination accounts, thus avoiding status bucket conflicts (the name of the
status bucket is computed from the source and destination host).
