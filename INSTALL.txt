I - Requirements

a) Building Tools

Two tools are required in order to build the tool:
 - cmake (minimum version: 2.4)
 - C compiler (support of the c99 standard needed)


b) Library dependencies

In order to build the cloud migration tool, you will need to have installed:
 - libdroplet (depends on libXml2)
 - libcurses
 - libmenu



II - Building the tool

a) Setup using CMake

As cmake searches and sets most of the information it needs, you may not have
anything to set up beforehand if your cmake version is properly installed. That
said, some cmake variables can help personalize the build, depending on your 
build environment (these are all facultative):
 - DROPLET_PATH             (the path of droplet installation: helps find it)
 - MENU_PATH                (the path of libmenu : helps find it)
 - CLDMIG_INSTALL_PREFIX    (the installation directory for 'make install')
 - CLDMIG_PKG_TYPE          (the type of package to build with 'make package')

Define these cmake variables when typing the cmake command with the -D option:
$> cmake -D THE_VARIABLE=the_value -D ANOTHER_VARIABLE=the_other_value

To keep the source directory clean while building, create an empty build 
directory wherever you want. Then change to the build directory and launch 
the cmake tool with the source directory root's path as an argument. 

Here is an example:

$> pwd
/home/$USER/downloads/cloudmig
$> mkdir build
$> cd build
$> cmake ..


If the cmake command outputs an error, then you may be missing a dependency.
Read cmake's output carefully to understand which dependency you are missing.


b) Compiling the tool

If the cmake tool does not output an error, then launch the make utility:

$> pwd
/home/$USER/downloads/cloudmig/build
$> make

The binary of both the tool (cloudmig) and its viewer (cloudmig-view) will be
created in the bin/ directory of your build root.

III - Installing from the source

a) CMake setup

For the installation process, you may want to define some cmake variables
allowing to setup a different installation path. The cmake variable
CLDMIG_INSTALL_PREFIX can be defined for this use through the cmake -D option
(see I - a for more details). By default, the install prefix is /usr/local/.

b) Installation

Now that everything is setup correctly, you can build the tool with the command
make and then install it with administrator privileges if the prefix you setup
is a system-wide path (like /usr or /usr/local). Otherwise, you only have to
type the command 'make install':

$> make
...
$> make install
...

Now, it's done ! The manpages for both tools (cloudmig and cloudmig-view) are
installed with the tools !


IV - Installing from the packages

a) Packages available

The distributed packages will install the files into the /usr directory. If you
want to install the tool within a different directory, the packages must be
built from the source, while defining the CMake variable CLDMIG_INSTALL_PREFIX.

Currently, two packages are available:
 - A deb package;
 - A rpm package.


b) Building your own package

In order to build your own package from the source (that may be in order to be
able to delete the source directory and still be able to uninstall the tool
whenever you want), you must first follow the steps for building, and you
may want to define the CMake variable CLDMIG_INSTALL_PREFIX in order for the
package to install the files somewhere other than in /usr. For example:
$> cmake -D CLDMIG_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..

This will setup CMake to build a package that will install its files into the
/usr/local directory.

All that is left is to build the package itself with the make command and you
will be ready to install or distribute it:
$> make package.


c) Installing with a package

DEB package:
    Type the command 'dpkg -i the_package.deb' as an administrator and
    everything will be done for you. For example:
    $> sudo dpkg -i cloudmig-1.0.0-Linux.deb

RPM package:
    Type the command 'rpm -i the_package.deb' as an administrator and
    everything will be done for you. For example:
    $> sudo rpm -i cloudmig-1.0.0-Linux.rpm
